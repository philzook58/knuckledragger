    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The functional style of programming is founded on simple, everyday\n",
    "mathematical intuitions: If a procedure or method has no side\n",
    "effects, then (ignoring efficiency) all we need to understand\n",
    "about it is how it maps inputs to outputs -- that is, we can think\n",
    "of it as just a concrete method for computing a mathematical\n",
    "function.  This is one sense of the word \"functional\" in\n",
    "\"functional programming.\"  The direct connection between programs\n",
    "and simple mathematical objects supports both formal correctness\n",
    "proofs and sound informal reasoning about program behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other sense in which functional programming is \"functional\" is\n",
    "that it emphasizes the use of functions as _first-class_ values --\n",
    "i.e., values that can be passed as arguments to other functions,\n",
    "returned as results, included in data structures, etc.  The\n",
    "recognition that functions can be treated as data gives rise to a\n",
    "host of useful and powerful programming idioms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other common features of functional languages include _algebraic\n",
    "data types_ and _pattern matching_, which make it easy to\n",
    "construct and manipulate rich data structures, and _polymorphic\n",
    "type systems_ supporting abstraction and code reuse.  Coq offers\n",
    "all of these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first half of this chapter introduces the most essential\n",
    "elements of Coq's native functional programming language,\n",
    "_Gallina_.  The second half introduces some basic _tactics_ that\n",
    "can be used to prove properties of Gallina programs."

    "    ensure that you get full credit for your work!), please be\n",
    "    careful to follow these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "      - Do not change the names of exercises. Otherwise the grading\n",
    "        scripts will be unable to find your solution.\n",
    "      - Do not delete exercises.  If you skip an exercise (e.g.,\n",
    "        because it is marked \"optional,\" or because you can't solve it),\n",
    "        it is OK to leave a partial proof in your [.v] file; in\n",

    "        [Qed].  This will help you get partial credit, in case you\n",
    "        use that main theorem to solve a later exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You will also notice that each chapter (like [Basics.v]) is\n",
